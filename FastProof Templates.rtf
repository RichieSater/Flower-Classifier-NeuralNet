Subject:  Your FastProof
Hi Quinn and Drew,
Great call last week! We've scoped out your FastProof based on our discussion around automating your deep value research process.
We're ready to present the specific prototype we'd build - focused on that intelligent second-stage screener that captures your historical PEG analysis and contextual filters. The goal is to build an automation that lets you analyze 10x more opportunities without hiring additional analysts, while automatically flagging those "hidden gems" that slip through traditional screeners during sector comparisons.
Let's jump on a quick call and walk through the approach and timeline.
What's your availability in the coming days?
Best, Richie
