Amy,
Thanks for the strategic guidance on the call. Based on your advice to focus on one use case with committed champions, I've developed the pilot framework using Tom's stat-ledger-to-tax-ledger automation as our reference case.
I'd like to schedule that in-person NYC meeting with you and Santhosh within the next two weeks to review the pilot economics and get your feedback before approaching any partners about client engagement.
The model shows clear ROI on KPMG's pilot investment through reusable deployment across their client base - exactly the "build once, benefit many" approach you mentioned.
When works best for you both the first week of August?
Best, Richie






Here's what I'm seeing from the KPMG situation:
The Good:
* Tom (Managing Director) literally said "Let's get them exclusive and let's go to market"
* KPMG sees you as differentiation against Palantir's Foundry
* They have $4B in "Continuing Improvement" revenue annually - this is your entry point
* Amy from Ventures is engaged and gave you a clear playbook
The Constraint:
* You're stuck in demo hell instead of moving to pilot execution
* Single client dependency is making partners nervous (they called you out on Kensington being $1.6B of that $1.8B)
* You need to get through BRET process before any partner can sponsor you to clients
Your Financial Model Priority Today: Don't build some generic partnership projection. Build the Pilot-to-Scale ROI Model that shows KPMG exactly what Amy told you to show:
1. Pick Tom's specific use case (stat ledger to tax ledger push)
2. Show pilot investment vs. return when they can reuse it across clients
3. Make it crystal clear who pays (KPMG client, KPMG venture arm, or KPMG BD budget)
4. Demonstrate the "build once, deploy many" economics
