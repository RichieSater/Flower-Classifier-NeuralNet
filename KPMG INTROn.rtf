INTRO Section
My name is Richie Sater, I’m the CEO of 4Thought Technologies, I was one of this years Nominees for EY Entrepreneur of the Year and I’m a Principal Investigator or PI for the National Science Foundation.  But before all of that I worked for Santhosh at EY.   
We worked together on some major transformation projects bringing clients like Coinbase to EY.  I left EY in 2021 to start 4Thought, which has had a lot of success - we’ve been funded by both Venture Capital and the US National Science Foundation.  From 2021-2023 we used grants and funding to build the technology and infrastructure you are going to see today.
Then in January 2024 we launched a front office product on top of the infrastructure.  It's what 18 months later and that front office product now has over 1.8 Billion dollars in Customer AUM.
4Thought is building a back-office product using the same technology and we are looking for a Go To Market Partner.  We have started talks with EY and started their BRET process, (that’s in part where the Entrepreneur of the Year thing came from) - but to make a long story short I reconnected with Santhosh who told me to talk to KPMG before going further with EY.  I take anything Santhosh says very seriously and he thinks KPMG would be a better partner.  So that’s how we got to this call.
