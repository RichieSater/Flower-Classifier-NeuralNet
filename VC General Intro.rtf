My name is Richie Sater, I'm the CEO of 4Thought Technologies. I was one of this year's nominees for EY Entrepreneur of the Year, and I'm also a Principal Investigator for the National Science Foundation.
Before starting 4Thought, I worked at EY on major transformation projects with clients like BlackRock, BlackStone, Goldman, Coinbase, etc.. I left EY in 2021 to start 4Thought, which has had significant success.
We've been funded by both Venture Capital and the US National Science Foundation. For three years we used grants and funding to build our core technology and infrastructure - what you're going to see today.
In January 2024 we launched our front office product on top of this infrastructure. It's what 18 months later and that front office product now has over 1.8 Billion dollars in Customer AUM.  We're also in talks to partnering with KPMG on some back-office use cases.

The way I normally run these pitch calls is to try to make it more of a show and tell.  I usually start by pulling up the tech so you can see it, I have slides but I jump around a lot I try to make it as interactive and question answer based as possible but before we start I wanted to ask you - what was it about my emails that made you want to jump on this call?
