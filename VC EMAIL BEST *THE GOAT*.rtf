Hi {{Name}}, we have customers managing $1.8B+ AUM who are working with us to automate their trading strategies and cutting deployment periods from 12+ months to under 3, without losing governance or compliance control.


Quick snapshot on milestones achieved:
* $500K+ from 2024 enterprise pilot (ARR poised to double in 2025)
* $1.8B+ Customer AUM (TLW Capital, Kensington Asset Management, Roca Bank Intl.)
* $967K annual savings at flagship customer
* KPMG in advanced partnership discussions after seeing our front-office results


We’re on our way to capture the $22B financial automation market and I thought it might be worth comparing notes to see if there’s alignment.


Let me know what you think?


Best,


Richie Sater
